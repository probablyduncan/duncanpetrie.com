The Cauldron is a circular inland sea, wrapped by Dylund and the Sheepstrath to the west and north, and by Halfisle and the Orchard Coast to the east and south.

Many towns on the Cauldron are a part of the [Inglenook](), a loose government centered in [Daybreak]().

Here are some regions, landmarks and towns around the Cauldron:

### The Strait Away

> The only natural way out of the Cauldron is through the Strait Away, a scary, skerried channel between [Halfisle Head](halfisle#) and the isle of [Hetch](). The worst of it is a tide-dragged stretch called Hetchy Gut.

### Daybreak

> Daybreak ([main article](daybreak)) is the largest city on the Cauldron.

{/* ### Hetch

Hetchy Gut ! */}

### Yellowbile

> On the north coast of the Cauldron, sat squat on the murky shores of Surley Bay, is the pleseant city of Yellowbile. The bay is connected to the rest of the Cauldron only by the Yelleget, a small, deep channel known for strong tidal currents and the ragged masts of shipwrecks seen in the lows of winter. The east headland is called Honk, and the west headland Yawn.

> The town was named for the gut-wrenching passage through Yelleget, and the effect it might have on greener helmsmen. As a result, Yelleget pilots are much valued and much paid.

> Yellowbile itself is a fine city, if cold and rainy. There's not much crime. There's not much of anything, really. Shephards come down from the Sheepstrath, the occasional merchant gone out of their way. You'd expect more from a city of that size. It's a nice place to raise a family, at least.
