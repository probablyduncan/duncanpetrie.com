intro: "[Dylund] is a quiet swath of farms and fields between the Cauldron to the east and the Wencewood to the west. It is the breadbasket of the Inglenook, a land of rustling corn and long shadows on the dry ground and crows flying black across the early twilight."

Dylund is a quiet, long-shadowed swath of wheat fields and lone farmhouses and market town fairgrounds on the western coast of the [Cauldron](). It is easy of the [Wencewood](), north of [Elessey](), and south of the [Sheepstrath](). It is the source of most of the Ingle's grain.

It is a land of rustling corn and long shadows on the dry ground and crows flying black across the early twilight. It is an autumnal place, even in spring, an orange October country.

It is home to meadowlarks and lonely spirits and folk who're bound to roam. Travellers and traders come across the [Whistlewinds](), bound for the Cauldron, and they do not tarry long in Dylund. It appears a haunted place, not by ghouls or nightmares but by things unknown, unbound, the husks of autumn myth with nowhere else to go.
