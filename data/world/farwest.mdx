You know, they say you run far enough towards the horizon the waves drop away under you and you keep right on runnin, sail off into the stars.

Run so far west you pass the sun, and when it sets again it sets in the east, the whole world inverted.

Some things to expect in the far far west:

- Great wing√©d worms on the foul western wind
- Mages older than the land itself
- Banners waving ragged at the dying light
- Towers stained orange by the setting sun
- Ruin and ruin and beauty and ruin
- Withered gleam on the battlements
- Power gone from the halls of power

Here, we know, and we worry, of all the possibilities that might befall ourselves. The ailments, the illness, arthritis and gout and the goitres and boils. They do not know. They glide through their halls with their golden cloaks; they do not worry.
