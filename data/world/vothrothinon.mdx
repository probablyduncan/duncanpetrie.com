Vothrothinon is a wild, volcanic peninsula far to the north. It is the northernmost reach of the [Mora Mez√©barac](mountains#), broken only by the rough coast of the [Watermaw](sea#the-watermaw). Vothrothinon is also the name of the highest peak in that land, which spews fire across the Watermaw and the [Frothing Sea](sea#the-frothing-sea). Little is known about those that live in that place.

### Kezek

The only known city in that land is a strange place called Kezek. It is intricate, delicate, and built entirely of large, glittering, spherical things. There is not a straight line anywhere. It is inhabited by an intense, speechless, wide-eyed, people, who move like spiders around and among their spheres.

It is unknown how much of this is true. It is easy to spin tales about a place your readers will never visit. For all the world knows, the people of Kezek are just like you and I. Or, perhaps it is a city of actual spiders. Can't know unless you go.
