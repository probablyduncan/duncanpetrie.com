Rhingdar is a kingdom in the cradle of [Gezhewaht](mountains#), the great south arm of the Western Mountains. Within the circle of mountains is the great [tidal](tide) plain Alal, which wraps around the perennial bay of Bahal. In the winter, Bahal is a small bay and Alal is farmland and sand dunes, and in the summer, Bahal rises, and Rhingdar's mountain cities, built just above the summertide line upon the sandstone foothills of Gezhewaht, become ports to the outside world.

## Khuat

The most significant summerport in Rhingdar is Khuat. It is a vertical city, perched atop a red rock shoulder overlooking Alal. All down the cliffside are wood-slat balconies and scaffolds and houses carved into the sandstone.

In the mild, dry winter, the [tide]() is out, the city is fully exposed, and Alal is fertile farmland for fast-growing crops. Come summer, the water rises, and for 4 or 5 months the cliff is entirely submerged and ships dock upon the height of the city. Some cave houses are designed like diving bells, with airtight rooms higher than the door to store belongings, but most caves flood entirely.
