The sea that I see is a mirror,\
the hue of the sun-faded sky.\
But I hear that beyond our horizon\
is a shore where the winds never die.

Hark! Here it is, an end to this lull,\
fill our sails and our souls with the breeze.\
Let us fly at a run to the red rising sun,\
till the tillerman runs out of seas.
