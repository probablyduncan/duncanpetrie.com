The grand old city of Alexa, capital of [Elessey](), sits in the wide, protected [Southgate Sound](). It is a city of old bell towers and tapestries in quiet halls and white limestone baths overlooking the bay and the Gut of Elessey. It is a regal place with a certain nostalgia for aristocracy, and although there is no longer a monarchy, there are plenty of royalists, and a lively Society.

## Inspiration

Alexa was named after the Billy Joel song _[Downeaster Alexa](https://open.spotify.com/track/39cFQHfY6tsdMRmSbFse3X?si=9b25889f5f934d0e)_, for some reason. This was before the Amazon one. I'm not sure how that fits in here. */}
