Harthacnut was the king of [Daybreak]() a very long time ago. He rarely showed. He did not understand why a king should have to work.

He spent lots of time in the forests of [Halfisle](), where he grew up.

Once [October](tide#octobering), he went Zigglewomping, the age-old practice of hunting the great beast [Zigglewomp](zigglewomping). Unlike everyone else, he survived.

When he was an old man, after decades of intermittent kingship, he disappeared for good. Some say they've seen him wandering. Some say they've seen him quite recently. Who knows what he got up to.
