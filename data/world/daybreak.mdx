Sat in the saddle of the [Cauldron's](cauldron) eastern shore, between the [Orchard Coast](orchardcoast) and dappled [Halfisle](halfisle), is the tousled, ruffled mess of Daybreak, the largest city in sight and the only city anyone's ever heard of.
\
\
Here are some neighborhoods:

**Middlehill**

> A high, central part of Daybreak, along the western side of Lake Harold. Rowhouses and grand hotels and mansion blocks like the Arcadian look out over the sea to the west and the lake and park (?) to the east.

**The Iron Quarter**

> Vibrant, prolific, creative place, good food, etc. It is beautiful and steeped in culture.
The people of the Ironfells are hard-edged and uncreative at home, but those that move south expand in the heat and the sun and are generally artsy and successful and sophisticated folk.

**Raggamud Hill**

> Raggamud, Raggamud, yada yada Raggamud

**Harbortown**

> North of the canal on the western edge of the city

**Alimony Row**

> See desc in book I guess
