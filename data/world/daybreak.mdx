Daybreak is the largest city on the [Cauldron](). Click [here](cauldron#towns) to see more Cauldron towns.

Sat in the saddle of the Cauldron's eastern shore, between the [Orchard Coast]() and dappled [Halfisle](), is the tousled, ruffled mess of Daybreak, the largest city in sight.

Daybreak is an ithsmus town, with the open sea to the east and the Cauldron to the west. Most of the city, however, is on the Cauldron shore. A wide canal and a series of broad Locks (Inkey Lock, Harold Lock, East Lock, and the Dock Lock) connect the two shores. The harbor at the western mouth of the canal is always full, and the canal is often clogged as well. The long way into the Cauldron, round [Halfisle Head](halfisle#) and through the [Strait Away](cauldron#the-strait-away), only takes an extra day or two, but its a rough sail up into the hardy north winds, especially in winter.

Government? Politics? People? Daybreaker? What's goin on here?

Here are some neighborhoods:

### Middlehill

> A high, central part of Daybreak, along the western shore of Lake Harold. Rowhouses and grand hotels and mansion blocks like the [Arcadian]() look out over the sea to the west and the lake and park (?) to the east.

### Harbortown

> North of the canal on the western edge of the city

### The Iron Quarter

> A vibrant, prolific, creative place, with good food and small gardens. It is beautiful and steeped in culture. Traditionally inhabited by bright and colorful Ã©migrÃ©s of the [Ironfells](), the Iron Quarter is now more of a cultural buffet.

### Raggamud Hill

> Raggamud, Raggamud, yada yada Raggamud

### Nettlefields

> A boring-in-the-wealthy-sort-of-way neighborhood some distance south of the city. It's the kind of place you move to when your money exceeds your taste. Residents view it as a part of Daybreak, but those who actually live in the city say otherwise.

> It is also home to a large fairground, at which every April people from across the city throw aside their snobbery-against-snobbery and have a good, fancy time. There is beer, music, little flags between skinny wooden poles, and even a [horse track](brothertobadbugs).

### Sunnyside

> The eastern coast of the city, that which faces the open ocean, is high and sparse and tree-lined.

### Alimony Row

> See desc in book I guess

### what would this place be called

> The Centers for Policy Institute

### The Sewers lol

> Gastrpunks
