100 years ago, the Baron of [Inselberg](drumlind#inselberg) was born in [Alexa](). His family, the hereditary rulers of the town of Inselberg, had lived in Alexa for generations; it was a fashionable place to be émigré nobility, and little remained for them in the quiet old country.

Royal titles did not hold as much weight, there, as they used to. There was no Society, not anymore. Just village people, in village halls, drinking pints of village hops.

So the family stayed in Alexa. The Baron was raised on [Cirwellan Wine](Elessey#cirwella) and tomato pie, on great literature and great schoolyard pranks. He wasn't a pleseant child, or a reverent child, or a mindful child, but he was clever, and charismatic, and altogether a product of his upbringing.

When the Baron turned 20, he went to Inselberg for the first time. He went, ostensibly, to see his dear great aunt, but what he actually saw was opportunity.

Inselberg was perfect. An unplanted seed, an unwound spring, an ripe, low-hanging pear. It sat at the mouth of the [Dun Rivery Valley](drumlind#the-dun-river-valley), around a stark and solitary knoll, the perfect perch for a castle. The Dun, there, fed into the tideless and bountiful [Auburn Sea](), where the whitefish and trout almost jump into nets, where blueberries erupt on pillowy granite islands and trees lean right down to the water's edge, where moose and mink and black bear and beaver are unbothered and free. The low plains around up the Dun were wide and flat and fertile, and the [Wencewood]() had all the lumber one would ever need.

But the town had problems. The folk there had grown satisfied and lazy in the face of such bounty. Despite the perfect topography, there was no castle on the Inselberg. The townspeople, it seemed, were afraid of provoking a band of so-called [druids]() who lived nearby, in the [Oxfoots](mountains#the-pineteeth), and so they had not built in a long time. There were crop-thieves and brigands in the Wencewood, and bully emissaries who came down from [Dunwald](), and, worst of all, nobody had any intention of doing anything about them.

The place needed a leader, a spine. It needed its identity back.

The Baron left Inselberg for Alexa, but Inselberg did not leave his mind. He hatched a plan.

He would return, bring settlers with him to bolster the town, craftspeople, skilled farmers, mercenaries. He'd clear out the brigands, tax trade on the Dun, build the castle the town deserved. There were improvements to be made.

Alexa had an affinity for royalty, and an affinity for populism, and the Baron had little trouble finding support in the Drumlish part of town. _Return triumphant! Recover the Homeland!_ That sort of thing.

He commissioned a fleet of 5 ships to patrol the Auburn Sea and trade up and down the Dun. In the end, 130 settlers packed their things and climbed aboard. There were couples, cows, children, cornseed, ailing elderly who wished one last time to see their place of birth. On the 6th of September, as the highest tide of the century began to recede, they left Alexa.

They sailed through [Elewir]() and round [Arieth]() and into the brackish estuary of the River Ain, and after three weeks of slow, windless sailing they entered the [Auburn Sea]().

The Baron took them straight to Inselberg. They moored in the mouth of the Dun, and the Baron took a small party ashore: Kelt, the carpenter, whose grandparents lived in Burl; Tick, the mercenary, whose great uncle was a farmer by the Dun; and Mingle, the baker, whose mother came from Inselberg.

They landed at the dock, and were greeted by a man with a large, floppy hat.

"Who is the leader of this town?" asked the Baron.

"Oh, we don't really need one of those," said the man with the large, floppy hat. "We get along fine, you know how it is."

"Well, who makes the decisions?"

The man with the large, floppy hat thought about that for a second. "We all do, I suppose."

"But who &ndash;"

"When there's a decision to be made, we all make it. Sometimes we talk about it, first." He shrugged. His hat shrugged with him. "Over there, in that longhouse." He pointed to a squat yellow barn overlooking the bank of the Dun.

"May I come to a meeting?"

"Tonight, yes? The farmers come into town when the moon is bright."

Mingle the baker looked at the moon, full in the southern sky.

"Yes," said the Baron. "We will come."

That night, the Baron and his landing party returned to the town. Kelt brought a woodsaw, Tick brought an iron-tipped spear, and Mingle brought a loaf of bread.

When they arrived at the longhouse it was glowing like the moon. The Baron flung open the door.

"Hello, people of Inselberg."

The room fell silent. There were two long, full tables down the whole of the house. A fire was crackling against the far wall. The man with the large, floppy hat was in the corner, looking expectant.

The Baron stooped under the dark, heavy beams in the ceiling.

"I am the Baron of Inselberg. My great great grandfather . We have lived afar for 
I have returned."

The townspeople stared back at him.

"I have come with many of your kin."

first the baron talks about history lineage etc?
they go and the baron asks about moving everyone in, 
they're like well we don't have much room, 
the baron is like but we can help, my craftsmen have skill, my mercenaries have arms, etc etc,
they're like we are happy here, we have everything we need, we lack nothing,
the baron is like we can improve things around here,
they're like we weren't aware we needed improvement,
the baron gets angry but Mingle calms him back, maybe Tick argues?
they go in a huff

maybe come back in the spring, they say, we have little to share in the winter but come spring we will have more for you
he's like no we don't need anything we want to turn this place around




And then, that winter, a plague befell them.

She could see the man's floppy hat on shore. It made him look like a puzzled dog, long eared, head tilted.

The river never truly recovered. Ever since, 

And the masts of the great ships remembered themselves and grew branches and needles and long pinecones.
