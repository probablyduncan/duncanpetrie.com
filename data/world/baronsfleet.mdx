100 years ago, the Baron of [Inselberg](drumlind#inselberg) was born in [Alexa](). His family, the hereditary rulers of the town of Inselberg, had lived in Alexa for generations; it was a fashionable place to be émigré nobility, and little remained for them in the quiet old country.

Royal titles did not hold as much weight, there, as they used to. There was no Society, not anymore. Just village people, in village halls, drinking pints of village hops.

So the family stayed in Alexa. The Baron was raised on [Cirwellan Wine](Elessey#cirwella) and tomato pie, on great literature and great schoolyard pranks. He wasn't a pleseant child, or a reverent child, or a mindful child, but he was clever, and charismatic, and altogether a product of his upbringing.

When the Baron turned 20, he went to Inselberg for the first time. Ostensibly, to see his dear great aunt, but what he actually saw was opportunity.

Inselberg was perfect. An unplanted seed, an unwound spring, an ripe, low-hanging pear. It sat at the mouth of the [Dun Rivery Valley](drumlind#the-dun-river-valley), around a stark and solitary knoll, the perfect perch for a castle. The Dun, there, fed into the tideless and bountiful [Auburn Sea](), where the whitefish and trout almost jump into nets, where blueberries erupt on pillowy granite islands and trees lean right down to the water's edge, where moose and mink and black bear and beaver are unbothered and free. The low plains around up the Dun were wide and flat and fertile, and the [Wencewood]() had all the lumber one would ever need.

But the town had problems. The folk there had grown satisfied and lazy in the face of such bounty. Despite the perfect topography, there was no castle on the Inselberg. The townspeople, it seemed, were afraid of provoking a band of so-called [druids]() who lived nearby, in the [Oxfoots](mountains#the-pineteeth), and so they had not built in a long time. There were crop-thieves and brigands in the Wencewood, and bully emissaries who came down from [Dunwald](), and, worst of all, nobody had any intention of doing anything about them.

The place needed a leader, a spine. It needed its identity back.

The Baron left Inselberg for Alexa, but Inselberg did not leave his mind. He hatched a plan.

He would return, bring settlers with him to bolster the town, craftspeople, skilled farmers, mercenaries. He'd clear out the brigands, tax trade on the Dun, build the castle the town deserved. There were improvements to be made.

Alexa had an affinity for royalty, and an affinity for populism, and the Baron had little trouble finding support in the Drumlish part of town. _Return triumphant! Recover the Homeland!_ That sort of thing.

He bought a fleet of 5 ships to patrol the Auburn Sea and trade up and down the Dun. The largest he named the _Coronet_, for it was to be under his personal command. In the end, 130 settlers packed their things and climbed aboard. There were couples, cows, children, cornseed, ailing elderly who wished one last time to see their place of birth. On the 6th of September, as the highest tide of the century began to recede, they left Alexa.

They sailed through [Elewir]() and round [Arieth]() and into the brackish estuary of the River Ain, and after three weeks of slow, windless sailing they entered the [Auburn Sea]().

The Baron took them straight to Inselberg. They moored in the mouth of the Dun, and the Baron took a small party ashore: Kelt, the carpenter, whose grandparents lived in Burl; Tick, the tavern guard, whose great uncle was a farmer by the Dun; and Mingle, the baker, whose mother came from Inselberg.

They landed at the dock, and were greeted by a man with a large, floppy hat.

"Who is the leader of this town?" asked the Baron.

"Oh, we don't really need one of those," said the man with the large, floppy hat. "We get along fine, you know how it is."

"Well, who makes the decisions?"

The man with the large, floppy hat thought about that for a second. "We all do, I suppose."

"But who &ndash;"

"When there's a decision to be made, we all make it. Sometimes we talk about it, first." He shrugged. His hat shrugged with him. "Over there, in that longhouse." He pointed to a squat yellow barn with a thick thatch roof overlooking the bank of the Dun.

"May I come to a meeting?"

"Tonight, yes? The farmers come into town when the moon is bright."

Mingle the baker looked at the moon, full in the southern sky.

"Yes," said the Baron. "We will come."

That night, the Baron and his landing party returned to the town. Kelt brought a woodsaw, Tick brought an iron-tipped spear, and Mingle brought a loaf of bread.

When they arrived at the longhouse it was glowing like the moon. The Baron flung open the door.

"Hello, people of Inselberg."

The room fell silent. There were two long, full tables down the whole of the house. A fire was crackling against the far wall. The man with the large, floppy hat was in the corner, looking expectant.

The Baron stooped under the dark, heavy beams in the ceiling.

"I am the Baron of Inselberg. My ancestors were lords of these lands, but our family has lived afar for many generations. Now, I have returned."

The townspeople stared back at him.

"I have come with many of your kin. We arrived, as you may have seen, in a fleet of 5 ships. We are skilled craftsmen, and farmers, and fighters." He turned to his companions. "We bring gifts."

Kelt and Tick and Mingle laid their woodsaw and spear and loaf of bread on the nearest table.

The room was silent. A woman shouted from the back, "we already have a saw!"

"And what do we need a pointy stick for?" asked a scruffy old man.

"We'll take the bread, though," said another. "Thank you for that."

A girl at the front of the room tore off a chunk of the bread and smiled at Mingle.

"We come," said the Baron, "to join your town. In exchange for your hospitality, my craftsmen will build and my farmers will farm and my fighters will defend. We need only beds and a warm hearth."

Another pause. Then, the man with the large, floppy hat spoke.

"We hardly have room for ourselves, here. I do not think we could accomodate all of&hellip; how many are you?"

"We are one hundred and twenty nine strong," said Tick.

The townsfolk murmured. "No," said the man with the large, floppy hat. "We cannot accomodate you."

"But we can help," said the Baron. "My craftsmen have skill. My mercenaries have arms. We will make this town thrive and grow. You will flourish."

"We are happy here. We have everything we need. We have company and warmth and fish in our nets and plenty to drink. Our harvest is full. We lack nothing."

"You are missing my point," said the Baron. "We can improve things around here. Wealth from trade on the Dun. An end to the thieves and brigands. A castle on the hill."

"A castle for whom?" shouted a woman in the back.

"I was not aware we needed improvement," said the man with the large, floppy hat. A chorus of aye's around the room.

Tick burst out, "You are damning yourselves! My great uncle farms the banks of the Dun. I was here, as a child, and I saw rough men come from the woods and reap what my own kin sowed! Will you let yourself be robbed by thugs?"

"Who is your great uncle?" asked one of the villagers.

"His name is Yelner."

"I know him," said the scruffy old man who had rejected Tick's spear. "Those folk are not thugs. They are woodsmen. They live in the forest east of here. We invite them to come and to share in our harvest."

Tick was silent.

"Perhaps you should come back in the spring," said the man with the large, floppy hat. "We have little to share in the winter, but come spring we will have more for you."

"We don't need _your_ help! We are offering _ours_!" said the Baron.

Mingle put a hand on the Baron's shoulder. "Come," she said. "You have done all you can, tonight."

He knew she was right. The townspeople watched them leave and watched the longhouse door swing shut behind them.

They walked alone back to the dock. Tick rowed the skiff back out to their mooring. His strokes were shallow and fast.

"We should go back," he said. "They'll be asleep soon. We don't need them."

"No," said the Baron, tired.

"We don't. They are weak. We have more men. We could simply replace them."

Mingle looked out at the moon on the water.

Eventually, she spoke. "We should go home, to Alexa. While the weather is fair."

"Not yet," said the Baron. They reached the mooring and he led them over the gunwhale of the _Coronet_.

"Baron." A woman, her voice urgent, came up from the cabin. "One of the old ones. Someone's grandfather. He died when you were away."

"Where?"

"Below. Others are sick."

"Of what?"

"We don't know."

The four of them followed the woman down the narrow stairs.

"It has only effected the old ones, so far."

Several hammocks had been hung in the hold. They were each of them full, and dripping with fever.

The Baron approached them. One of them he knew, old man Say. His skin was pale and it looked like wax in the candlelight. He was not awake. His eyes were closed but his mouth was open, dry, softly gasping. His leg twitched.

"It is spreading?"

"Maybe," said the woman. "It does not seem to effect everyone."

The Baron reached out and put a hand on the old man's wrist. The old man grabbed the Baron's hand, tight. His expression did not change. His eyes did not open. He moved like an invisible weight was upon him.

The Baron pulled himself away. It had been a long night.

"We should keep to the _Coronet_, tonight," he said. "Until we know more. Come, let us find our cabins. We should not be here." He beckoned to Tick, who was peering into one of the hammocks.

The night was cold. A high wind swept clouds across the stars, dark shadows on the darker water. A loon called, lonesome, eerie. Someone hadn't'properly rolled the topsail, and it filled and flapped, lazy in the breeze. A child cried on one of the other ships. The ailing in the hold made no sound, save the slow creaking of the hammocks.

Tick paced in his cabin.

It wasn't right. Here on the water, cold, while the simple townsfolk sat warm in their hall. Giving their bounty to brigands in the woods, with none to spare for their homecoming kin. None to spare for those that could actually make something of that town, that bungling.

And worst of all, it could all be theirs. One night. One fell swoop.

The Baron had a plan. To bide their time, to let the people of Inselberg warm to his words. As much as he stood to gain from his plan, the Baron had no ill will upon the townsfolk. He wanted to be let in, to be welcomed back.

That would happen eventually. Well, probably.

The Baron had ambition. He had charisma. But he lacked one thing. Guts, he had no guts.

Tick had guts. And he knew there were others, here, that would feel the same.

That's what happens when you don't sort your apples before you bring them home. You feel good about the harvest, feel proud bringing a basket so heavy, but who knows what you've brought back with you.

The Baron might not have had the guts to finish the job, tonight, but he'd had the guts, in Alexa, to bring Tick here with him. And wasn't that the same thing?

It would only take a little fearmongering. Villagers scare easy. A fire, a bit of shouting, a &ndash; yes! A brigand-raid. The accent was easy enough, the rough behavior. Slaughter a chicken. Run like thieves with a barrel of beer.

He could rouse a few to help him. Some would surely scorn at the force, the nerve of the idea, but that would be mock dismay. They weren't really kin, not after all these generations, not after refusing their help.

He could end this. Inselberg would have a Baron once more.

Why shouldn't he?

He threw on an overcoat and took a bottle of oil from his trunk. He opened the door to his cabin, quiet, and went up onto the deck. He drifted over to the side of the _Coronet_ and climbed down onto the skiff. Then the oars were in his hands, then he was bobbing across the water.

Up the side of the _Silver Moon_, where he found Gallin and Rub and Hickle, bored, up for an outing. They rowed to the _Sandy_, woke Nickel and Funt. Both had spears. In the hold of the _Fairwind_, they roused Yolky and Wigbin and Rint, and on the _Dear Linda_ they found Spink, wiry, bony, sharp-faced, who was picking his teeth with a dagger.

They were ten on the skiff, low in the water as Tick rowed them to shore.

Their brigander-accents were not as good as Tick had hoped. Hickle and Rint could do it well enough, so they would do the shouting. Tick would set a fire. The rest would steal and make noise.

They stepped up onto the dock. The men were tense. They did not speak.

Spink had a tinder-box, so he went with Tick.

They ran down the shore. Tick scanned the houses for an easy fire. Something small, an outbuilding. Nothing anybody would sleep in.

They passed the longhouse. "Hold," said Tick to Spink. He ran into the longhouse. Where was the beer? A small cask would do. He looked behind chairs, under the tables. There, at the back! Three little barrels, each the size of a newborn. He cradled one in his arms.

He heard a crackle outside. A holler. The others must have started.

He popped the bung from its hole and took a sip. It was a fine brew, thick and strong, a warmth between his ears.

Right. Onward.

He stopped the cask and held it under his arm and hit open the door. The warm breeze rushed inwards.

Warm?

Spink was knelt under the eaves of the longhouse. He had something in his hands. Something bright.

Tick called his name but it was too late. The roof was ablaze.

He dropped the cask and ran to pull Spink from the flames. Spink turned back and smiled. "Set fire, boss," he said.

It was too late.

Tick grabbed the cask and smashed open the end and threw the beer onto the longhouse, but the fire had spread too much. The river was close. He ran to the water and filled the cask and threw the water onto the flames. The fire raged.

What had he done?

He grabbed Spink by his bones and started to run back along the shore.

The others were between the houses, pulling up fences and posts, throwing mud at front doors. He heard Hickle and Rint, somewhere, shouting. They had forgotten their accents.

He couldn't leave them. Could he?

Suddenly, they reached the dock. There was the skiff, softly bobbing.

He looked at Spink.

The rest of the men, the ones who could not do the brigander-accent at all, had begun to shout as well.

Were there also the voices of the townsfolk? Or was he imagining?

His head was pounding.

"Spink!" he yelled over the sound of his ears. "We have to go back, we have to get the rest." He sent Spink down one street, and Tick went down another. When the bony man was out of sight, Tick turned back to the dock and ran.

When he was almost to the skiff, he heard a door open. He turned. It was the farmer, the one who had rejected his spear. He looked dazed, looked up at the sky. Then their eyes met.

Tick ran. He jumped in the skiff, shoved off and rowed faster than he ever had before. He could see the whole town, like this. Lit up in brilliant orange. The longhouse was no more than a pile. He saw the men he had roused, running and hollering.

Were those his men? There were women, too. They looked older, and were dressed in long clothes, and carried knotted sticks.

He saw a sliver of a silhouette that could only be Spink, standing in the center of the road, backlit by the fire of a burning bale of hay. There was another shape, there, behind him. Spink turned, and jumped, and started to run, but there was nowhere he could run, and his knees knobbled and cracked like branches and he lay still in the mud.

The skiff hit the stern of the _Coronet_. Tick swore. He threw the skiff's bowline over the gunwhale and climbed up onto the _Coronet_ and tied off the line where it had always been tied. He felt his bottle of oil, untouched, in his coatpocket as went belowdeck and slipped soundlessly into his cabin.


{/* *tick sneaks off to the other ships and rouses supporters from each
*the little raiding party goes ashore and wrecks havoc. They burn the longhouse? 
*the brigands come from the woods
*one of them hits tick over the head and the raid sort of peters out
*they bring him back unconscious, as the woodsmen throw rocks?
*in the ruckus, they are mixed, the ailing with the rest
*they leave, head east along the shore, find a place to set up camp

And then, that winter, a plague befell them.

*it was bad, etc

They tried once more to come ashore.

But the druids were there. In their illness they barely made it off their boats. The druids and their earth magic chased them back to their ships

And the masts of the great ships remembered themselves and grew branches and needles and long pinecones.



She could see the man's floppy hat on shore. It made him look like a puzzled dog, long eared, head tilted.


So they try to raid once and it doesn’t spread the illness itself but it mixes everyone up so the whole expedition is contaminated and they can’t separate the ships. They stay the winter, maybe move up shore where they can forage in the woods, set up camp, and there the plague befalls them. Tick is still festering and he dreams up a plan and they all go back to inselberg to take the town but the druids are there and they send them back? */}
