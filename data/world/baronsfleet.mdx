100 years ago, the Baron of [Inselberg](drumlind#inselberg) was born in [Alexa](). His family, the hereditary rulers of the town of Inselberg, had lived in Alexa for generations; it was a fashionable place to be émigré nobility, and little remained for them in quiet Drumlind.

Royal titles did not hold as much weight, there, as they used to. There was no Society, not anymore. Just village people, in village halls, drinking pints of village hops.

So the family stayed in Alexa. The Baron was raised on [Cirwellan Wine](Elessey#cirwella) and tomato pie, on great literature and great schoolyard pranks. He wasn't a pleseant child, or a reverent child, or a mindful child, but he was clever, and charismatic, and altogether a product of his upbringing.

When the Baron turned 20, he went to Inselberg for the first time. He went, ostensibly, to see his dear great aunt, but what he actually saw was opportunity.

Inselberg was perfect. An unplanted seed, an unwound spring, an ripe, low-hanging pear. It sat at the mouth of the [Dun Rivery Valley](drumlind#the-dun-river-valley), around a stark and solitary knoll, the perfect perch for a castle. The Dun, there, fed into the tideless and bountiful [Auburn Sea](), where the whitefish and trout almost jump into nets, where blueberries erupt on pillowy granite islands and trees lean right down to the water's edge, where moose and mink and black bear and beaver are unbothered and free. The low plains around up the Dun were wide and flat and fertile, and the [Wencewood]() had all the lumber one would ever need.

But the town had problems. The folk there had grown satisfied and lazy in the face of such bounty. Despite the perfect topography, there was no castle on the Inselberg. The townspeople, it seemed, were afraid of provoking a band of so-called [druids]() who lived nearby, in the [Oxfoots](mountains#the-pineteeth), and so they had not built in a long time.

There were crop-thieves and brigands in the Wencewood, and bully emissaries who came down from [Dunwald](), and, worst of all, nobody had any intention of doing anything about them.

The place needed a leader, a spine. It needed its identity back.

The Baron left Inselberg for Alexa, but Inselberg did not leave his mind. He hatched a plan.

He would return, bring settlers with him to bolster the town, craftspeople, skilled farmers, mercenaries. He'd clear out the brigands, tax trade on the Dun, build the castle the town deserved. There were improvements to be made.

Alexa had an affinity for royalty, and an affinity for populism, and the Baron had little trouble finding support in the Drumlish part of town. _Return triumphant! Recover the Homeland!_ That sort of thing.

He commissioned a fleet of 5 ships to patrol the Auburn Sea and trade up and down the Dun. In the end, 130 settlers packed their things and climbed aboard. There were couples, cows, children, cornseed, ailing elderly who wished one last time to see their place of birth. On the 6th of September, they left Alexa.

They sailed through [Elewir]() and round [Arieth]() and into the brackish estuary of the River Ain. They stopped, as was customary

After two weeks of slow, windless sailing they entered the [Auburn Sea]().

And then, that winter, a plague befell them.

the hereditary Baron of Inselberg, living in Alexa
he takes a trip to his homeland, for the first time, and decides he wants it back
there are improvements to be made, after all
there are thieves and brigands come out of the oxfoots
the place needs a leader, needs its identity back
so he goes back to Alexa, commissions a fleet
rounds up loads of Drumlish folk to bring them back home
he will teach them to fight on the journey
he brings 5 strong ships up the river ain, and they arrive in the auburn sea
but that winter, a plague befalls them



maybe he is power hungry, sees an empire around the auburn sea
there are brigands and thieves come out of the oxfoots, after all, and he can put a stop to them
restore peace to the inland sea, and have it for himself of course
so he goes to alexa where great ships are built and commissions a fleet


Into the [Auburn Sea]().

And then, that winter, a plague befell them.

The river never truly recovered. Ever since, 

And the masts of the great ships remembered themselves and grew branches and needles and long pinecones.
