There's a cold wind, and it's coming here today\
There's a cold wind, and it's coming here to stay\
There's a cold wind, and it has a lot to say\
If you listen to the whistle of the wind

There's a cold wind, and it's awful far from [home](ironfells)\
There's a cold wind, blowing in between my bones\
Telling tall tales of the places it has roamed\
When you listen to the whistle of the wind 

There's a cold wind, you can see it in the trees\
And the tall grass, and the skittering of leaves\
And the branches know this ain't just another breeze\
For they've listened to the whistle of the wind

There's a hot fire, and it's just around the bend\
Of this long road that don't seem to have an end\
There's a hot fire where I will sit and then\
I will listen for the whistle of the wind
