The most prominant mountain chain on [Yon]() is the western range. It goes by many names, and cuts the world in two, stretching from [Vothrothinon]() on the [Frothing Sea]() in the far north, to end in a claw around [Rhingdar]() to the south.

Sections of the range, from south to north:

### Gezhewaht

> In the far south, the mountains are called Gezhewaht. They cradle Rhingdar, and they are the eastern slope of the [Evening's Empire](eveningsempire), although there they are more commonly known in the Old Edyan way, as [Elbalad](mountains#elbalad) or Harengad. There they are a ruddy mix, soft sandstone mixed with hard grey-pink granite. There are caves and crypts in those hills going back miles, down miles, into the depths.

### The Pineteeth

> In [Drumlind]() they are known as the Pineteeth, the Red Mountains, or the Western Mountains. They rise out of the woods, sharp and clean and grey, with matchstick trees on their ridges and mountain goats on their peaks. The range is deep and glaciered, but little snow is visible from the foothills.

> The Pronghorns is an offshoot at the end of the mountains as they wrap east around Rhingdar. They stretch out between [Gandrin's Run](), the high, mild plateau, and the [Auburn Sea](auburnsea). They are low and inviting and rarely snowy.

> The Oxfoots, similar and close to the Pronghorns, is a small offshoot of the Pineteeth which stretch east into [Drumlind](). Wooded and sharp, they are full of forts and caves and hunters' cabins.

### Elbalad

> In Old Edyan the mountains are called Elbalad and Harengad. This eastern central slope of the range is grey-white and tall, rising suddenly from the green plains of [Edya](). The birch forest [Ilfalas]() is nestled against this slope in a wide shallow valley, and the ancient fortress [Estgard]() protects one of the few passes east.

### Harakarákan

> In the north, the folk of the [Ironfells]() and the [Outlands]() know the mountains as Harakarákan. Here they are dark and impassably cold, full of leopards and bears and beasts unnamed.

### Mora Mezébarac

> In [Goblund](), the mountains are called Mora Mezébarac, and they rise out of the [Mistfens](goblund) and the [Fellsplit](ironfells) to the west of Goblund. The high, sharp hills there are a foggy mirage of the spires of old black fortresses and wire-thin crags of inky black rock. At their northernmost point, as they meet the crashing sea around the [Watermaw](), they are called Mora Morudra.
