On the dry washes and red-rock valleys and salt flats of [Daggarlund]() and [Blisterlund]() roam the nomadic Wasteriders. They follow the table-snails, mesa-snails, slow and steady migrators across the flat wastes. They leave residual slime in the wash which wandering nomads destill with their beakers and flasks. In a place where water is so rare, they have to take what they can get.
