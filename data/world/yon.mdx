This project - _Yon_, or _Springtide_, or _The World_, or whatever else I decide to call it - is many years in the making.

## The Ancient Past

I started making maps when I was 10 or 12, I'm not really sure. I'd make worlds with friends, or doodle alone, little mountains and forests and squiggly coasts.

I drew the same few shapes again and again, version after version. I wasn't really sure what I was after, but I knew I liked those elemental swoops and forms.

In bigger maps, even though the coastlines would change and features would come and go, I always used the same names. I felt like I was uncovering a place that already existed.

## Going Electric

Around 2016, I started making maps with a drawing tablet in Photoshop.
