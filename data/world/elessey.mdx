Elessey is a region nestled between the [Ingle](), the [Holt](), [Dylund](), and [Ealdor's Rest](ealdorsrest). Its capital is the regal city of [Alexa]().

Its borders are somewhat disputed. The government in Alexa officially controls the inland between the Ingle and Dylund, the wide [Southgate Sound](), the eastern edge of the [Holt](), and the long peninsula of Cirwella, known for its vineyards.

Culturally, however, Elessey encompasses the western half of the [Orchard Coast](), the [Isles of Whimsey](whimsey), and even old [Jouge-on-Jouge](jouge). While Alexa is full of expat aristocrats and monarchical nostalgists and elitists of High Society, the rest of Elessey is mild and sun-bright, having plenty and wanting little. It is a place of art and fine boats.
