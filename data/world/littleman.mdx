Little man\
Edge of [heaven](heavensofzed)\
You walked so far\
You climbed so high

Little man\
Edge of heaven\
Don’t you know?\
You’re still alive

And I see a tear on your cheek\
And I fear you won’t find what you seek, here\
I can’t let you in, no I can’t let you inside

Toothy smile and two pigtails?\
And wind is always in her sails?\
I know her very well, yes I know her very well

She’s found a friend in everyone\
Climbed all our trees and touched the sun\
She’s doing very well, yes she’s doing very well

Flowers growing in the dirt beneath her fingernails

Little man\
Edge of heaven\
Did you read\
The sign on the cloud?

Little man\
Edge of heaven\
Loitering\
Is not allowed

So you see, you must say goodbye\
And we’ll meet when the time’s finally right\
Take your time on your walk, take your time on your walk home

The mausoleums of your mind\
Are no place now to spend your time\
You ring a silent bell, yes you know it very well

Your boots are made for walking and\
The worlds kaleidoscopic and\
What else are you to do, and what else are you to do?

What else, what else, what else are you supposed to do?
