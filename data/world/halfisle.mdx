Halfisle is a mostly wild peninsula of cedar bogs and sandy open fens and square, white, green-capped bluffs, each a suggestion of a bay just beyond. It rises north from [Daybreak]() and separates the [Cauldron]() from the wide open sea.

_"I read a play about Halfisle, once. The old elite of Daybreak, it was their backyard. A sweet place. Bucolic. For all I know, it still is._

_"It is a land of cherries and pancakes and sugar shacks where sap is boiled in spring. Where inland lakes freeze, come winter, and the locals skate on bladed boots and cut holes in the ice to fish for bluegill and walleye and pike. Artists sick of the squalor of Daybreak come to paint the ships and steeples and worn white bluffs of Halfisle. It is, I think, a thistleberry pie on the windowsill sort of country."_

## Landmarks & Destinations

### Primtoe

> Primtoe, the closest cottage town to Daybreak, is the unfashionable person's idea of a fashionable place to go. It's not uncomfortable, or unpleseant, or ugly. It's clean. It's easy. But why would you play at something when you could do the real thing? 

### Frid

> Frid is nice. There's a little babbling creek and a beach of smooth white stones and sailboats at bouys in the bay. The baker's name is Arms Delilah, and the bread she makes can be smelled across town. A painter, Louie Lousef, brings a fresh baguette to the end of the town dock every morning, where he paints the sun come up.

### Port Cherry

> Unlike most harbors on Halfisle, Port Cherry is still functional. Lobster pots and floats and weights line the docks. Fishermen in skifs and skips and doggers and trawlers leave late in the evening and return with the rising sun and a netfull of whitefish or salmon or, sometimes, nothing.

> The Port Cherry Market is the largest on Halfisle. All the fish of the day, produce from the inland farms, furniture, weavings, tonics, pies, all can be found under the sagging roof of Market Hall. The old barn has seen many summers, and drooped at the weight of the snow of many winters, but it stands still. At night, the hall is host to dancing and drinking, gamboling and gambling, hooting and hollering, in the form of the venerable Port Cherry Social Club.

### Dore

> Dore is a quiet town of steeples and masts and cedar-shingle roofs. It is known as an artists' haven, full of woodworkers and painters and throwers of clay.

### Hart Harbor

> The northernmost town on the Cauldronside, Hart Harbor is nestled in a high, stoney, south-facing bay. It is hidden from the brunt of the wind by the Bluebluff, a blueish-white promontory with a little red lighthouse on top.

### Halfisle Head

> The long way into the Cauldron creeps around Halfisle Head, the northernmost point of the peninsula. It forms the southern shore of the [Strait Away](cauldron#the-strait-away).

### Hither

> The open shore of Halfisle is wild save Hither, brambled and empty compared to towns on the Cauldronside. The forest road is scrappy and narrow

### The Driftwood Shore

The driftwood coast, cliff made entirely of driftwood, roots of current trees tying them all together, cave houses carved into the wood above the waves
