In the dusty red distance rode a man with a hat on a horse called Dove. The late sun burned low behind him, and though the heat still rippled across his dark silhouette it was vanishing fast. Even now, the first star in the eastern sky. Elmedhris. The stars came early, this time of year.

The name of the man was Ervin Bandolier, and he’d left, days ago, from Wearinesse at the edge of the Outlands. It was a long, hard ride: fifty miles or more of gravel and sagebrush and wide old washes, memories of water. A few ranches, now, in this lower country, scattered redoubts of the brave and the foolish. These were unfriendly folk in an unfriendly land. And for good reason. They were all of them gamblers, and they’d bet against soil tough as toothpicks, soil that froze too early and loosened too late. Rusty iron windmills creaked lonesome in the breeze to mark each ranch. Skeletal, wiry, like wishbones picked clean. Ervin learned to keep his distance.

The light of Vermillion Sage had crept up over the horizon. Ervin was glad to see it, much as he loved the trail. Dove was running thin, and the scrap in his saddlebags was wearing her. She'd do nicely with a long drink of water. He'd do nicely with a drink as well.

It was a hard life, but he liked it. Never wanted for anything else. The air was clear, the hills were wide. Picking through slag in the clinker fields, making camp under lonely, leafless trees. Lots of time to think about nothing.

There was nobody there at the entrance to town. He brought Dove to a post outside Sugarbud and pumped a pail full of water from the well in the road and set it down for Dove. The light of the Sugarbud marquee glared down at him. The lettering was wobbly. and they'd run out of O's. 

_Lucky Slug! Cne Week Cnly! Drink and Games! Fight!_ They advertized like there was anywhere else to go.

Most towns had a lagers guild. Some had brawlers’ guilds, gamblers' guilds. A few had a extortioners’ guild. The genius of Sugarbud was to put them all in the same building. Nowhere else could compete with that.

He walked inside. The air was dry and he smelled all sorts of smoke.

He went to the bar, saw old Vernon already staring back at him. "You know you shouldn't be here," he said to Ervin.

"Yeah."

"He's been in a mood, lately," said Vernon. He pulled out a bottle of Dowager and handed it to Ervin.

"Hell, you said that all the times before, Verne."

"Don't push your luck, is all I'm saying."

Ervin took his drink to a table. It was Cooper, a game of sticks. Out here, they used dyed wood, but the game was the same.

The first round was poor. He was delt mostly oaks, but the trick was all pine. The woman next to him was good. She played a fine hoop of cherry and cedar and the pine from the trick. Second round he won, with a pattern of cherry and fir. Third round, the woman's hoop was ten-stave. Fourth was a pale fellow sat low in his chair. The woman won the fifth and sixth. She took each pot with thin arms and long fingers. She wore an amethyst ring.

The seventh deal was good. He got maple and walnut. His hoop was strong. The dealer laid down oak and a cedar stick and, yes, more maple. An even pattern. Not much can beat that. He put down his last coin. All in.

The woman with the amethyst ring turned her barrel. It was all cherry. She smiled at him. He groaned.

He got up, went back to the bar. Maybe Verne'd take pity.

Verne wasn't there, so he sat down and took off his hat. His hair was matted and dusty and the dust made a cloud as he scratched his head.

Somebody tapped him on the shoulder. His stool squeaked as he swivelled around.

The Man Himself was staring at him.

Gimbling stood on his side, the right hand man. Gombling, brawn to Gimbling’s brains, stood to the left. Primarily a pair of a pair of fists, they were why Sugarbud ran so smooth. Gumbling, the other brother, sat in the corner.

“Well, well,” said the woman with the amethyst ring from the other end of the bar. “The brains, the brawn, and the third one. Making another guest’s day, I see.” 

“Buck off, Jessamine,” said Gimbling.



She rolled her eyes. She had a pile of hair like sagebrush rooted to her head, curling, tangling upwards. A wide, bright violet was stuck above her ear, and its petals glowed in the warm eclectic light of the room.

"You owe the man "




Hmm so at some point they are forced to approach a ranch
Coming down from yalish and the harrowhills
There is a dust storm
He wrapped his jewel-blue scarf close to block the dust
A horse called Dove and a donkey called Quail



Ervin Bandolier, who in his youth wandered the scraplands, and Jessamine Quick, who tamed the wanderer’s heart
They camped to share the night and for the first time in his life Ervin’s bedroll was warm.
They even tried to have children, once, but the pair was infertile as the lands they loved.
