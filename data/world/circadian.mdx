Circadian Zandalack was looking forward to the autumntide.

But not for the usual reasons. He wasn't running down to a cottage on the [Orchard Coast](), or gallivanting off with the sous-chef's wife, or jumping on the slow boat to far [Ossea](). 

No, he wasn't leaving at all. He was going to stay right here, at home, on the lower ground floor of the Hotel Telemet, and he was going to enjoy it.

Everyone always seemed so surprised. What would he do, here, all by himself? Whats the point of a doorman, in a hotel with no guests, no staff?

He'd never felt the pull of that tide. Betty loved to talk about the thrill of Octobering, the hell-with-it rush out the door and the smell of the wind when your back is to home. Betty, of course, who spent the winter in Gentrey. Not even a day down the coast. The water, there, just as cold as here.

Circadian, frankly, liked to be left alone. He was good, alone. Good with his thoughts. A lot of people he knew, they couldn't go five minutes without breaking the silence. A lot of people were afraid to be alone.

He looked up and saw Ms. Phinkter coming swift across the plaza. He pulled his gloves up his wrists and opened the door.




There was a different sort of anticipation, though. The anticipation of the whole neighbourhood, the whole of Raggamud, empty.

It wasn't that he didn't like them all. They had their quirks, of course. It would be nice to have a break.


The Hotel Telemet was grand, optimistic. Its walls were made of polished, sun-orange, thick-cut stone, and its windows were as tall as glass can blow. The curtains could be used as sails. It was square, flat roofed, 
It was the kind of building, the kind of testament to human progress, that gets built at the turns of centuries. 

The particular century of the Hotel Telemet, however, was not one of the recent ones.

But as the years piled up they weighed heavy on the hotel, pulling, straining it, warping its floorboards and bending its ancient pipes.
