The sea is all around us. It is ever changing, ever churning. The [tide]() is ever dragging in and out.

Here are some of the seas around [Yon]():

### The Cauldron

> The [Cauldron]() is a wide, calm bowl of a sea, cut from the rest by [Halfisle]() and the [Ingle](). It has its own page with more.

### The Headwinds

> North of the Cauldron, off the coast of the [Uphills]() and southern [Hithlid](), are the Headwinds, a rough patch of seas named for the harsh winds that whip down from the north. One must sail through the Headwinds to reach the [Sanguine Sea](sea#the-sanguine-sea).

### The Sanguine Sea

> Separating the [Wildermoor]() from the south is the Sanguine Sea. It is a grim, stagnant, offputting water, where the surface shimmers like oil and shadows drift below the surface. Being so close to the [Scraplands](), the Sanguine Sea is said to be full of all manner of strange, perverted relics of primordial [Numir](). The city of [Tåsk](task) is the only place people live on its shores, but they are a strange people, so I wouldn't say it counts for much. In a sheltered cove in the southwesternmost reach of that sea is [Dowager Bay](), gateway to the [Hornwood]() and a logging town.

### The Waterworks

> The sea between [Wregedlek]() and the [Rainspatter]() is known as the Waterworks, for it is always thrashing, always churning, always sinking ships. Few can make it through alive.

### The Baleful Bay

> Far to the icy north, between [Queen Agnes Land]() and [Etyermaetslund](), is an oft-frozen sea called the Baleful Bay, where seals play and leviathan sea-beasts hibernate. Its southern reach is often known as [Grölkin's Haunt](grolkin).

### The Watermaw

> Surrounded and speckled by black islands and wind-battered coasts and ancient [Goblish](goblund) fortresses is the Watermaw, a deep and high-walled bay. [Vothrothinon]() and a chain of unnamed islands separates it from the open northern ocean. The seabirds there are large and terrible, scaly, horned, as much dragon as gull.

### The Frothing Sea

> On the other side of [Vothrothinon]() is a wide open water known to some as the Frothing Sea. I'm not sure why anyone would go there. It was thus named not because somebody explored it, but because somebody needed a name for an empty square of a nautical map.

### Berehlias

> The [edyan](edya) word for ocean is Berehlias, and thus is the Edyan Ocean called. It is large, an abstract thing, roughly bounded by the [Eagle's Talon]() to the south, Edya to the north east, and [Othlethin]() to the west. A great wind called the Urinoth blows down from the north, riling Berehlias and battering the [Barrier Isles](eaglestalon#the-barrier-isles).

### Eleafe

> Eleafe is a great, turquoise, circular inland sea in the heart of [Edya](). It used to be the _heartland_ of Edya, before it was sunk in an ages-ago war. The sea is situated over the ancient, fertile floodplain of the grand river Ain. Now, it is separated from [Berehlias](sea#) by the [Nymris Archipelago](nymris).

### Balmbight

> The warm, tidal waters south of far [Ossea]() are called the Balmbight. Islands like Werrey and Wence protect it from the open ocean, and it is a light-breezy, paradisiacal place.

### The Middle Sea

> The Middle Sea, or the Neaping, or the Neap, is a large, tame inland ocean at the center of the world. Its shores are calm and mild, but rife with pirates! So watch out.

> I should probably write a separate page for the Neap. If it exists, it's [here](neap).
