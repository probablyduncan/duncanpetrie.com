Out the window through the branches of the maples in the churchyard:\
sorrowed singing of the bells, ‘tis another day gone by.

And it gets so late so early in this candlelit November,\
all those hours of the night to wish I could’ve asked him why.

And the wind against the windowpanes, the tapping of my pen\
upon a barely started letter which I cannot seem to end.

And the leaves they swirl like dancers in the road between the people,\
collars turned against the autumn and there go the bells again.
