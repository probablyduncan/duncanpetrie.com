Old alabaster Edya, flame of the west.

Land of tiles.

When old explorers from the [Cauldron]() first came to the sunken ruins of [Erungalar](), they marveled at the clear blue water lapping against the white tile walls. Those tiles looked so good, they thought, in a watery setting. They brought some home and showed everyone they knew. This is the origin of bathroom tiles.
