I walk a muddy track through a [field](dylund) of wilted wheat\
I got a map that ended miles ago and blisters on my feet\
I don’t know where I’m going and I don’t know who I’ll meet\
But I know wherever I go I can’t never linger

I met a lonesome weary lady lying in the mud\
She said stranger don’t you like this little grave I dug\
She said won’t you lay with me and we’d be like two spuds\
I just smiled for a little while and I said I’m bound to wander

I saw a band of merry men were stealing from the pope\
They emptied out his pockets, trussed him to a tree with rope\
I asked him should I free him and he only just said nope\
I asked why, and he said my, I need this time to ponder

I climbed upon a mountaintop, sat on that mighty stone\
The view it flew along for miles across the land I roamed\
And there in hazy distance was the place I once called home\
I heard the beating of my heart and felt it growing fonder

I came upon a scarecrow it was walking awful slow\
I said where you even going man and he said I don’t know\
He said I never ever had a gut or bones to call my own\
He looked at me like a bag of leaves and said he had a hunger

It was autumn when I left, was fall when I returned\
It's hard to cross a [river](dylund#the-borderline-river) when all the bridges have been burned\
But I crossed the current mightily and kissed the shore for being firm\
They asked me then oh where I'd been, and I just said over yonder
