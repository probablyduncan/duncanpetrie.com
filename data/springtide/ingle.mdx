The Ingle is an elbow peninsula which splits the [Cauldron]() from the wide open sea. Its northern tip is known as [Halfisle](), land of quiet woods and limestone bluffs. Just below that, it is severed by the canal of [Daybreak](). Pastures and woodlands and cities like [Glibbish]() and [Dudwin]() make up the heart of the Ingle. Its southern coast is called the [Orchard Coast]().

## The Inglenook

Politically, the region is known as the Inglenook. It is centered in [Daybreak](), and encompasses the whole of the Cauldron. It borders [Elessey]() to the south and [Dylund]() to the west.

It is seen as the center of progress. There are cities with industry and people with firm grasps on the nature of the world. It is a place of knowing. Expeditions from the Ingle have mapped the whole of the world, charted and catalogued all manner of bird and beast. The Ingle gets its wheat from [Dylund]() and its wood from the [Hornwood]() and its iron from the [Scraplands]() and the [Iron Shore]().
