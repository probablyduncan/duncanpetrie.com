The Cauldron is a circular inland sea, wrapped by [Dylund]() and the [Sheepstrath]() to the west and north, and by the [Ingle]() and [Halfisle]() to the east and south. It has lesser [tides](tide) than most shores of the open sea, and there is no need, there, for summerports and winterports.

Many towns on the Cauldron are a part of the [Inglenook](ingle#the-inglenook), a loose government centered in [Daybreak](). Other cities around the Cauldron include [Hetch](), an island port at the west end of the [Strait Away](cauldron#the-strait-away), [Yellowbile](), a quiet place guarded by a treacherous channel, and [Glibbish](), home to Ingle House and the School for Typographic Arts.

Here are some landmarks around the Cauldron:

### The Strait Away

> The only natural way out of the Cauldron is through the Strait Away, a scary, skerried channel between [Halfisle Head](halfisle#) and the isle of [Hetch](). The worst of it is an infamous, tide-dragged stretch called [Hetchy Gut](hetch#hetchy-gut).

### Daybreak Canal

> For a very long time, the only way out of the Cauldron was through the Strait Away. Now, [Daybreak](#geography) has a canal to the wide open sea. It runs from the sea-facing Bay of Legs to Daybreak harbor, Cauldronside, and severs [Halfisle]() from the rest of the [Ingle](). It is often clogged with ships, however, so many still make the few-day journey round [Halfisle Head](halfisle#).

### The Wallowrock

> Just offshore of [Glibbish]() is the island they call the Wallowrock. It is home to birds, an old fort, a campus of a Glibbish design school, and, purportedly, a band of [Druids]().

### The Isles of Wick

> Off the the western shore of the Cauldron is a band of isles called Wick. There is Crookwick and Bigwick to the north, [Midwick]() in the center, Weewick to the south, and Yorwick behind them all. Midwick is the largest, home to a port of the same name.
