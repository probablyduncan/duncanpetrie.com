I've learned to hate the man upstairs\
Who stamps his feet and slides his chairs\
He scrapes and drags and thumps around\
My ceilings are his stomping ground

I hear his ire and all his glee\
I hear it all, the symphony\
His heavy romps throughout the night\
And little stomps of wild delight

I think he always wears his clogs\
He has about a thousand dogs\
Who bark and yowl at every hour\
I hear him singing in the shower

Accordion, he plays it well\
Though still a novice on cowbell\
I live his life, through all his creaks\
I'd dream of him if I could sleep

I'd dream of when he tripped and fell\
And cursed, got up, and all was well\
I'd dream of when he stubbed his toe\
A cry, a hop, on with the show

I'd dream of how his voice might sound\
Outside this muffled underground\
I'd dream of what I cannot see\
His favorite chair, his face in glee

I think he cooks for all his friends\
And all the things he breaks, he mends\
I think he wears a tailored suit\
I think he buys a lot of fruit

I think he's tall and has a limp\
I think his hair is rarely clipped\
He walks his dogs to sea to swim\
I think, more like, his dogs walk him

I wonder where his family lives\
And if he's wronged, if he forgives\
I think he fills his walls with art\
I think he has a gentle heart

I wonder if I saw his eyes\
I wonder if I'd recognize\
The same old man I've known for years\
Who lives above my chandeliers

And what he does when he is still\
I cannot say, I never will\
Perhaps he reads and sips his tea\
Perhaps he writes a poem, of me!

I've learned to love the man upstairs\
Who stamps his feet and slides his chairs\
In stomping skill he has no peers\
He clangs like no one else has ears

But now, how could I live without?\
I dread the day when he moves out\
I will survive, 'til that day comes\
At least he doesn't play the drums
